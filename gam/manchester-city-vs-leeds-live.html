Welcome along to this afternoon's live Leeds United coverage as the Whites take on Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. It's Sam Allardyce's first game at the Leeds helm and despite only taking over on Wednesday he'll be keen to see progress made on the field.

Leeds have three more Premier League games to play this season after this afternoon's fixture and anything they manage to pick up against the league leaders would certainly bolster their hopes of survival. In fact, they could move three points clear of the drop zone should they upset the odds and pick up a win in Manchester today.

There'll be no Liam Cooper, who has been ruled out through injury, while Tyler Adams, Luis Sinisterra and Stuart Dallas are also missing. We're reporting live from the Etihad Stadium all afternoon to bring you all the team news, build-up and match updates as Leeds face off against Pep Guardiola's side.

Manchester City can secure their place at the top of the Premier League table and move four points clear of Arsenal when they host Leeds this afternoon.

City returned to the top of the table with a midweek win against West Ham and know that the fate of the Premier League title is in their hands. Pep Guardiola will want to put as much distance between his side and the Gunners ahead of a difficult Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid in the upcoming week and three points against a struggling Leeds is a must.



For their part, Leeds are knee deep in a relegation battle and have turned to Sam Allardyce to lead them out of the fire. This is his first match in charge after he replaced Javi Gracia earlier in the week. Leeds sit 17th and are out of the relegation zone only on goal difference with a heap of tough fixtures to come - starting at the home of the league leaders.
